									<h2>Intro</h2>
									<p>I was always interested in other languages and cultures as a child. When I was growing up, I became fascinated with Native American cultures. Seeing how different people live has always been interesting to me.</p>
									<p>I attended the University of Northwester - St. Paul for my undergraduate where I triple majored in linguistics, intercultural studies, and biblical studies. I also double minored in Chinese studies and science & theology. It was during these years that I fell in love with minority and underrepresented languages. It was also during these years that I learned that technology can be used in amazing ways to provide practicle solutions to real problems. </p>
									<p>I originally intended on being a Bible translator. However, after learning more about myself, I realized that this was not the path for me. I still wanted to use linguistics in a useful way, and the world of academia held to interest for me. That's when I decided to commit my professional life to the field of computational linguistics.</p>

									<h2>Training & Grad School</h2>
									<p>Because of COVID-19, I was unable to find work for over a year. I was in the final stages of a long interview process for an entry coding position when the pandemic hit and everything closed down. </p>
									<p>I still wanted to improve my skills in programming, because I knew learning how to code could open up many new opportunities for me. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get into grad school the first time I applied. This left me a lot of free time for an entire academic year without a job.</p>
									<p>Even though I was very discouraged, I didn't want to give up on this path. Instead of just sitting around, I decided to take online courses that didn't require a lengthy application process. I completed Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" as well as her "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp". I also completed courses on EdX including "Probability from the Ground Up" and "Algorithms and Data Structures" as well as earning "IBM Python Data Science" professional certificate.</p>
									<p>In the summer of 2021, I was finally accepted into the MS in Human Language Technology through the University of Arizona. There, I've focused on taking courses that would better prepare me for a career in TTS/ASR technology.</p>

									<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
									<p>My first internship was a volunteer position with Dallas International University. Here, I worked with Chamikuro, an endangered language spoken in South America. Through this internship I learned a lot about data quality assurance as well as learning how to transcribe controlled language data using the Montreal Forced Aligner.</p>
									<p>My second internship was through the Summer Institute of Linguistics. I worked on the AI/NLP team where I was responsible for developing and automating a workflow that would produce a text-to-speech system based off of an audio Bible and its transcript.</p>
