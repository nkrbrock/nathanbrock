									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Find code <a href="https://github.com/sil-ai/nathan-internship-2022.git">here</a>.</p>
									<p>The purpose of this project is to convert an audio Bible along with its written transcript into a Coqui-TTS system. This task can be split up into 4 main areas: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Preprocessing. This was by far the most complicated part of the process to figure out. In order to automate this process with ClearML, preprocessing needed to be broken down into multiple steps:</li>
										<li>Montreal Forced Aligner</li>
										<li>Convert data for Coqui</li>
										<li>Coqui-TTS</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Preprocessing</h2>
									<p>This was by far the most complicated part of the process to figure out. In order to automate this process with ClearML, preprocessing needed to be broken down into multiple steps.</p>
									<p>One of these steps involved having to download and extract the audio files that the user needs into a designated folder. The audio for the initial runthrough were taken from <a href='https://open.bible/'>Open Bible</a>, an open source library of written and audio Bibles.</p>
									<p>Another step was splitting the biblical text into chapters and assign them names that align with MFA standards. The expected format for the text input is to have each verse on its own line. The vref file included in this project contains the corresponding verse for each line. This allows for a clean mapping between verse number and content, allowing us to easily figure out which chapters are present or not. Certain languages have only fragments of the Bible, just the New Testament, the whole Bible plus apocryphal works, etc. The current setup allows for this kind of variation in materials. Text is then split into individual chapters. In order for the Montreal Forced Aligner to work, it needs a .txt and .wav file with the same name. Open Bible has its files written as BOOK_###. For example: GEN_002 for Genesis chapter 2. The text files were named appropriately such that there is both a GEN_002.txt and GEN_002.wav.</p>
									<p>Besides the text and wav files, MFA needs something called a phonetic dictionary text file. This file contains word-pronunciation pairs with each sound separated by a space. Because there is no one module that can transcribe every language into the International Phonetic Alphabet, we simply use the letters in its indigenous writing system as long as it is written in a variation of the Latin alphabet. In order to figure out word boundaries, each verse is run through UToken, which is currently this project's biggest bottleneck as it only works on a select number of languages that can be viewed <a href='https://github.com/uhermjakob/utoken'>here</a>.</p>
									<p>An example entry of the MFA dictionary:</p>
									<p>calm    c a l m</p>
									<p>Before sending everything over to MFA, the audio needs to have the introductions cut out. That is because the transcripts are expected to only have verse. If the audio says "Genesis chapter one, in the beginning..." then "Genesis chapter one" would need to go. This is because MFA can easily be thrown off in its alignments and is incredibly difficult to get back on track. This cleaned audio will then be placed in the same folder as the chapter texts so that the alignment data is in its own folder separate from the dictionary.</p>

									<h2>Montreal Forced Aligner</h2>
									<p>The Montreal Forced Aligner is a program that takes in a pronunciation dictionary and a file that contains a matching set of audio and transcription files. It then calculates where it believes each word and phoneme takes place. This data is outputted into a .TextGrid file that contains the start and end time of each element.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Audio Split and Metadata for Coqui-TTS</h2>
									<p>Using the textgrids package, this information is extracted in a formate of <element, start_time, end_time>. We are then able to determine where the verses or sentences start and emd and split the audio accordingly. The newly split files are then placed in a new folder. Once the audio is formatted, a metadata.csv file needs to be created that maps the audio to its transcription with a format of AUDIO_NAME|TRANSCRIPT</p>
									<p>An example of this would look like:</p>
									<p>GEN_001|In the beginning...</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Coqui-TTS</h2>
									<p>Coqui-TTS is a free deep-learning resource that is used to generate text-to-speech models. It comes with a variety of models, but this project currently implements VITS, GlowTTS, and FastSpeech. Each model has its own benefit, so the user can configure the workflow for whichever model will best help achieve their goals.</p>
